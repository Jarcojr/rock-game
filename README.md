  Game tracks ball/rock interation as well as ball/window interation
  
  Score and time tracking for different colored rocks
  
  Clean, readable code structure

##What I Learned

  Using the random module
  
  Object interation in a graphical window
  
  Conditional functions

  How to create a timer function

##How to Run
  python main.py

##Example Output
  Place 5 rocks around the starting ball location
  Program runs for 30 seconds. Ball interations with rocks or window cause redirection and color change.
